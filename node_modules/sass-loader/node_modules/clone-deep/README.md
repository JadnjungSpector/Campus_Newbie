The `instanceClone` function is invoked to clone objects that are not "plain" objects (as defined by [isPlainObject](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`) if it is provided. If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.

The last argument specifies whether or not to clone instances (objects that are from a custom class or are not created by the `Object` constructor. This value may be `true` or the function use for cloning instances.

When an `instanceClone` function is provided, it will be invoked to clone objects that are not "plain" objects (as defined by [isPlainObject](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`). If `instanceClone` is not specified, this library will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will simply copy the object reference.
