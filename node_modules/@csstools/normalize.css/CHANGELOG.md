# Changes to @csstools/normalize.css

### 10.1.0 (June 3, 2019)

- Fixed: `Edge` comments without `Chrome` are are changed to `Edge 18-`.
- Fixed: `Chrome` comments without `Edge` have `Edge` added.
- Fixed: Nested list `dl` normalizations split.
- Fixed: Logical `margin-block` normalization changed to `margin`.

### 10.0.0 (May 16, 2019)

- Added: Removal of the margin on nested lists in Chrome and Safari.
- Added: opinionated.css, normalize.css with classic opinionated styles.
- Changed: Reverted license to prehistory state, or CC0-1.0 as intended.

> There are now 2 versions of normalize.css. Nicolas Gallagher and I started
> writing normalize.css together. I named and created the normalize.css
> repository with the help of Paul Irish and Ben Alman. I transferred the
> repository to Necolas, who made it into a “household” CSS library. Much
> later I resumed management of normalize.css with Luciano Battagliero. We
> tagged, deprecated, and removed “opinionated” styles — styles developers
> often prefer but which do not fix bugs or “normalize” browser differences.
> Necolas disagreed with this change, and resolved the matter AFAIK by removing
> all of the other contributors, locking discussion threads, wiping my name
> (and his) from all files, and blocking me from being able to follow the
> project.
>
> I may later create a new project with a new name, but for now I intend to
> continue working on the normalize.css project, sometimes under the
> “csstools” tag. I hope one day our differences are resolved and the projects
> will be one again.
>
> For reference within this project:
> normalize.css resolves bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
> opinionated.css does the same while preserving the classic opinionated styles.
